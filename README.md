<h1 align="center"> GSM Based SMS Alert Solar-Powered Fire Alarm System </h1>
<h2 align="center"> Term Project for EE212 Circuits and Systems Course </h2>

It is a term project which I designed for the concept of solar powered systems in the Circuits and Systems course. I aimed to combine the audible fire alarm, SMS warning and solar power features used in many systems in a single project. I encoded the circuit with Arduino IDE, which generates an audible alarm when the flame is detected with the flame sensor and sends a message to the user at certain intervals and with the desired limit when the ambient temperature rises above 45 degrees. In this way, in the event of a possible fire, I ensured that the user, both inside and outside, is warned in the most effective way in both cases.

One of the most important features of the system is that it is not dependent on any external source other than the Ni-Mh batteries that I used to store solar energy. Thanks to this project, I have a good experience of using multiple sensors and modules interactively in a single circuit.

This repository contains all Arduino codes used in the project.
